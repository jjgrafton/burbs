**Burbs**

**User Story**

Burbs is a web app designed for parents considering relocating from New York City to its suburbs.

**What problems does the app solve?**

Rather than have to look through websites for school information, crime statistics, real estate information,leisure facilities, daycare, transportation information etc, Burbs is designed to give a one-page overview of everything a parent could wish to know when considering where to raise a family, while acting as a portal to more detailed information.

**What are the MVP features?**

The MVP will offer information about towns on a single rail line, the Metro North line between Grand Central Station and Poughkeepsie. All information will be up-to-date as it will be called via APIs such as Google Maps, GreatSchools and Foursquare.

**What are the post-MVP features?**

A much wider range of towns and communities will be included, and the range of information will be increased to include detailed demographics, housing information, long-time statistical trends, weather, environmental information etc. More APIs will be sued to supply the most up-to-date data, such as the US Census, neighborhood data from companies like Zillow, and information from NY State's open data project.
